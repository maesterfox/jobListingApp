After living and studying in Portland, Oregon, where I obtained my degree and initially worked as a personal trainer, I transitioned into the tech sector with an internship at Intel's Hillsboro Campus. Since moving back to the UK in 2018, I have thrived in various contract roles, enabling me to work with a wide array of technologies and methodologies. This has not only broadened my technical skills but also my ability to adapt and excel in diverse environments.",
      "career_objective": "I am driven to continue developing my skills in cutting-edge technologies and innovative software development practices. Having honed my expertise through a variety of contract roles, which exposed me to a diverse range of technologies and methodologies, I am now seeking to transition into a permanent position. I am particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to leverage my robust background in a dynamic, collaborative setting. My goal is to find a company with a strong vision and a commitment to innovation, where I can contribute to challenging projects and grow within the organization over the long term. I am eager to bring my technical acumen and proactive approach to a team that values agility, continuous learning, and a customer-centric approach to development.",
      "hobbies_interests": "Passionate about health and fitness, I value staying active as a balance to the sedentary nature of software development. Engaging in physical activity helps manage stress and enhances my overall well-being, which is crucial in high-pressure environments. Outside of programming, I enjoy playing Warcraft, exploring new cities across the UK during random weekends away, and I am planning to extend these adventures across Europe. These experiences enrich my creative thinking and problem-solving skills, essential for my professional and personal growth."
